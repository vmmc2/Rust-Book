# Chapter 004 - Understanding Ownership

## Intro
* Ownership is the most important feature of the Rust language. Moreover, it's this feature that distincts it from other programming languages.
* It's also safe to say that such feature has deep implications for the rest of the language.
* __It's ownership that allows Rust to make its famous safety guarantees without the need of a Garbage Collector (GC).__
* __The concept of Ownership is tied to other important concepts:__
    * Borrowing
    * Slices
    * Data layout in Memory

## What is Ownership?
* __A set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.__
* Common approaches used by popular programming languages:
    * Garbage collection keep looking for unused variables in the memory while the programming is running (Java, Python, JavaScript).
    * Us, the programmers, must explicitly allocate and deallocate (free) the memory (C, C++).
* __Ok... But how does Ownership manages the memory? Such set of rules is checked by the compiler at compile time. If at least one of such rules is not followed, then the program won't compile and, thus, won't run.__
* Pay attention to the fact that the Ownership system does not slow down the execution of Rust programs.
* __It does take some time to get used to it, since it's a new way of programming. But as you get used to it, you will be able to write code that is more safe and performant.__

## The Stack and The Heap
* Both are region of the memory available for your program to use at runtime.
* However, there are a couple differences when it comes to how these regions of memory work and are structured.
* __Stack__
    * __Stores values inside itself following a LIFO (Last-In First-Out) policy.__
    * __All data stored inside the stack must have known and fixed size at compile time.__
    * __Have a well-defined structure due to its policy regarding insertion and deletion of elements.__
* __Heap__
    * __Stores values in a less-organized way.__
    * __The process goes as follows: The memory allocator finds an empty spot inside the heap that is big enough for the data that you want to store, marks it as 'being used' and returns the address of such location in memory (pointer).__
    * __Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer.__
        * How can I know the size of a pointer? Does the size change if it points to different types of data in the heap?
* Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack.
* Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.
* Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there.
* __A processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).__
* __When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.__
* __The main purpose of Ownership is to manage Heap data:__
    * __Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the Heap.__
    * __Minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the Heap.__
    * __Cleaning up unused data on the Heap so you don’t run out of space.__

## Ownership Rules
* __In Rust, there are 3 of such rules that must be followed no matter what.__
* __Such rules are:__
    1) Each value in Rust has an owner.
    2) There can only be one (1) owner at a time.
    3) When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.

## Variable Scope
* __A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid.__
* __The variable is valid from the point at which it’s declared until the end of the current scope.__
* __At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is similar to that in other programming languages.__

## The ```String``` type in Rust
* To better illustrate the concepts of the Ownership rules, we need to work with more complex data types.
* __Until now, we've worked with data types whose size are known and fixed at compile time. Values of such types can be easily stored inside the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over.__
* __Moreover, values of such types can be quickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another part of code needs to use the same value in a different scope.__
* __However, we want to look at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data.__
* We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every situation in which we may want to use text (keep in mind that string literal are immutable and not every string value can be known when we write our code).
* For these situations, Rust has a second string type called ```String```. __This type manages data allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time.__
* We can create a value of type ```String``` from a string literal using the following method:
```rust
let s = String::from("Hello, World!");
```
* Moreover, the ```String``` type can be mutated, while string literals cannot:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("Hello");
s.push_str(", World!"); // This method appends a string literal value to a String value.
println!("{}", s);
```

## Memory and Allocation
* In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string literals are fast and efficient. Such properties come from the fact that string literals are immutable.
* With the ```String``` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. This means:
    * The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
    * We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our ```String```.
* __How previous programming languages have dealt with the second action of returning pieces of memory back to the allocator?__
    * __In languages with a garbage collector (GC), the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC, it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget, we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one ```allocate``` with exactly one ```free```.__
    * __Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.__
    * Code snippet example:
    ```rust
    {
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward
        // do stuff with s
    }// this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
    ```
    * When a variable goes out of scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called ```drop```, and it’s where the author of ```String``` can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls ```drop``` automatically at the closing curly bracket.

## Variable and Data interacting with Move
* The code snippet below will work exactly as we think it would work in other programming languages: Bind the value 5 to ```x```. Then, make a copy of the value in ```x``` and bind it to ```y```. We now have two variables, ```x``` and ```y```, and both equal 5. This is indeed what is happening, because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two 5 values are pushed onto the stack.
```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
println!("x = {} and  y = {}", x, y);
```
* Now, let's do the same but dealing with the ```String``` type:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, World!");
let s2 = s1;
```
* __A String is made up of three parts: a pointer to the memory that holds the contents of the string (such content is stored inside the heap), a length, and a capacity. This group of data is stored on the stack.__
* __The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the ```String``` are currently using.__
* __The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the ```String``` has received from the allocator. The difference between length and capacity matters.__
* __IMPORTANT: When we assign ```s1``` to ```s2```, the ```String``` data is copied, meaning we copy the pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the data on the heap that the pointer refers to.__
* Rust does not copy the data on the heap because it would be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if the data on the heap were large.
* To ensure memory safety, after the line ```let s2 = s1;```, Rust considers ```s1``` as no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when ```s1``` goes out of scope. It essentialy performs a move from ```s1``` to ```s2```.
* In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.

## Variables and Data Interacting with Clone
* If we do want to deeply copy the heap data of the ```String```, not just the stack data, we can use a common method called ```clone```.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
``` 
* __Here, both the stack data and the heap data do get copied.__
* When you see a call to such method, you know that some arbitrary code is being executed and that code may be expensive.

## Stack-Only Data: Copy
* There's something that we need to cover yet. The code snippet below works and is also valid:
```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
```
* Types such as integers (and others) that have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack. Therefore, copies of the actual values are quick to make.
* That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent ```x``` from being valid after we create the variable ```y```. In other words, there’s no difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling clone wouldn’t do anything different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.
* __Rust has a special annotation called the ```Copy``` trait that we can place on types that are stored on the stack. If a type implements the ```Copy``` trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.__
* Rust won’t let us annotate a type with ```Copy``` if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the ```Drop``` trait. If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the ```Copy``` annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error.
* To find out which types implement the ```Copy``` train, you can check the documentation for the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar values can implement ```Copy```, and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of resource can implement ```Copy```.
* Rust types that implement the ```Copy``` trait:
    * All integer types.
    * All floating-point types.
    * The boolean type.
    * The character type.
    * Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement ```Copy```. For example, ```(i32, i32)``` implements ```Copy```, but ```(i32, String)``` does not (because the ```String``` type does not implement the ```Copy``` trait).

## Ownership and Functions
* The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just as assignment does.

## Return Values and Scope
* Returning values can also transfer ownership.
* The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it.
* When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by ```drop``` unless ownership of the data has been moved to another variable.
