# Chapter 008 - Common Collections

## Intro
* Rust’s stdlib includes a number of very useful data structures called __collections__.
* __Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain multiple values.__
* __The data these collections point to is stored on the heap.__
  * __The amount of data does not need to be known at compile time.__
  * __The data can grow or shrink as the program runs.__
* The three collections that are most used in Rust programs are the following:
  * Vector: Allows you to store a variable sequence of values from the same type next to each other.
  * String: Allows you to store a dynamic sequence of characters.
  * Hash Map: Allows you to store a dynamic number of pairs (key-value).

## Vector
* Vector is also known as ```Vec<T>```.
* Allows you to store more than one value in a single data structure.
* It puts all the values next to each other in memory.
* Only store values of the same type.
* The code snippet to create a new vector in Rust is the following:
```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```
* __As we've seen above, vectors are implemented using generics. This means that we have to add a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to store.__
* However, there is another common scenario: You might need create a ```Vec<T>``` with initial values and Rust will infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type annotation. Rust conveniently provides the ```vec!``` macro, which will create a new vector that holds the values you give it.
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```
* In the code snippet above, Rust creates a new ```Vec<i32>```. The integer type is ```i32``` because that’s the default integer type.
* Because we’ve given initial ```i32``` values, Rust can infer that the type of ```v``` is ```Vec<i32>```, and the type annotation isn’t necessary.

### Updating a Vector
* To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the ```push``` method:
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```
* As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable using the ```mut``` keyword.

### Reading elements of a Vector
* There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing (using the square brackets notation: ```[]```) or using the ```get``` method.
* The code snippet below shows both ways of doing such a thing:
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {third}");

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
    Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
    None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```
* Using ```&``` and ```[]``` gives us a reference to the element at the index value.
* When we use the ```get``` method with the index passed as an argument, we get an ```Option<&T>``` that we can use with ```match```.
* __The reason Rust provides these two ways to reference an element is so you can choose how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the range of existing elements.__
* Code Snippet that shows how to use both of strategies mentioned above:
```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let does_not_exist = &v[100];
let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
```
* Observations about each strategy:
  * __When we run this code, the first ```[]``` method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector.__
  * __When the ```get``` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns ```None``` without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal circumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either ```Some(&element)``` or ```None```.__
* Note: For example, the index could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a number that’s too large and the program gets a ```None``` value, you could tell the user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance to enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the program due to a typo!

### Borrowing and Ownership in a Vector
* When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the ownership and borrowing rules to ensure this reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid.
* Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same scope.
* That rule applies in the code snippet below, where we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end. This program won’t work if we also try to refer to that element later in the function.
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {first}");
```
* __The code snippet above looks like it should work: Why should a reference to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector?__
  * __This error is due to the way vectors work: because vectors put the values next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector is currently stored.__ 
  * __In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.__

### Iterating over the Values in a Vector
* To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all of the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time.
* Example #1: Using a ```for``` loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector of ```i32``` values and print them:
```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
  println!("{i}"); // What would be the correct way if: println!("{}", i); or println!("{}", *i);
}
```
* Example #2: We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to all the elements. The ```for``` loop below will add ```50``` to each element:
```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
  *i += 50;
}
```
* To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the ```*``` dereference operator to get to the value in ```i``` before we can use the ```+=``` operator.
* __Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the borrow checker's rules. If we attempted to insert or remove items in the ```for``` loop bodies above, we would get a compiler error similar to the one we got with the code above. The reference to the vector that the ```for``` loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the whole vector.__

### Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types
* __Vectors can only store values that are the same type.__
* __This can be inconvenient because there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of different types.__
* __Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different types, we can define and use an enum!__
* For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers, and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different value types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that of the enum.
* The Code Snippet below shows how to do this:
```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
  Int(i32),
  Float(f64),
  Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
  SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
  SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
  SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```
* Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element. We must also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of the vector.
* If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait object.

### Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements
* __Like any other ```struct```, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope.__
```rust
{
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
  // do stuff with v
} // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```
* __When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the integers it holds will be cleaned up.__
* __The borrow checker ensures that any references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is valid.__

## String
* Here, we'll take a deeper dive in the world of strings.
* New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three reasons:
  1. Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors.
  2. Strings being a more complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for.
  3. UTF-8.
* __We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.__
*  __We’ll also discuss the ways in which ```String``` is different from the other collections, namely how indexing into a ```String``` is complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret ```String``` data.__

### What is String?
* Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string slice ```str```.
* The string slice type is usually seen in its borrowed form: ```&str```.
* __String slices are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data elsewhere.__
* __String literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary and are therefore string slices.__
* The ```String``` type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.
* When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might be referring to either the ```String``` or the string slice ```&str``` types.

### Creating a New String
* Many of the same operations available with ```Vec<T>``` are available with ```String``` as well, because ```String``` is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities.
* To create a new and empty ```String``` in Rust, we can use the following:
```rust
let mut s = String::new();
```
* Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string with. For that, we use the ```to_string``` method, which is available on any type that implements the ```Display``` trait, as string literals do.
* The code snippet below shows how to do this:
```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

let s = "initial contents".to_string(); // the method also works on a literal directly.
```
* There's also another way of doing the same thing:
```rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```
* __The last 2 code snippets create a ```String``` from the string literal ```"initial contents"```.__
* __In other words, ```String::from``` and ```to_string``` do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style and readability.__

### Updating a String
* A ```String``` can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents of a ```Vec<T>```, if you push more data into it.
* In addition, you can conveniently use the ```+``` operator or the ```format!``` macro to concatenate ```String``` values.
* __We can grow a ```String``` by using the ```push_str``` method to append a string slice. The ```push_str``` method takes a string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the parameter:__
```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```
* The code snippet below only compiles without errors because the ```push_str``` method takes a string slice (which is a reference) as its parameter:
```rust
let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
let s2 = "bar";
s1.push_str(s2);
println!("s2 is {s2}");
```
* __There's also the ```push``` method that takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the ```String```:__
```rust
let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l'); // lol
```

### Concatenation with the ```+``` Operator or the ```format!``` Macro
* There are scenarios where you might want to perform concatenation of two ```String``` values.
* In such scenarios, you might want to use the ```+``` operator.
* You can do such a thing following the pattern showed in the code snippet below:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // Note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used.
```
* As you might have already guessed, the string ```s3``` will contain the value ```Hello, world!```.
* __The reason ```s1``` is no longer valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to ```s2```, has to do with the signature of the method that’s called when we use the ```+``` operator.__
* __The ```+``` operator uses the ```add``` method, whose signature looks something like this:__
```rust
fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
  // ...
}
```
* Here, we’ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we call this method with ```String``` values.
* The signature of the ```add``` method gives us some clues in order to understand how the ```+``` operator actually works behind the scenes:
  1. First, ```s2``` has an ```&```, meaning that we’re adding a reference of the second string to the first string. This is because of the ```s``` parameter in the ```add``` function: we can only add a ```&str``` to a ```String```. We can’t add two ```String``` values together.
  2. However, the type of ```&s2``` is ```&String```, not ```&str```, as specified in the second parameter to ```add```. So how does the code snippet above compile?
  3. The reason we’re able to use ```&s2``` in the call to ```add``` is that the compiler can coerce the ```&String``` argument into a ```&str```. When we call the ```add``` method, Rust uses a deref coercion, which here turns ```&s2``` into ```&s2[..]```.
  4. Because ```add``` does not take ownership of the ```s``` parameter, ```s2``` will still be a valid ```String``` after this operation.
  5. Second, we can see in the signature that ```add``` takes ownership of ```self```, because ```self``` does not have an ```&```. This means that ```s1``` in the code snippet above will be moved into the ```add``` call and will no longer be valid after that.
  6. In short, the last statement actually takes ownership of ```s1```, appends a copy of the contents of ```s2```, and then returns ownership of the result.
* For more complicated string combining, we can instead use the ```format!``` macro:
  ```rust
  let s1 = String::from("tic");
  let s2 = String::from("tac");
  let s3 = String::from("toe");

  let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");
  ```
  * The ```format!``` macro works like ```println!```, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a ```String``` with the contents.
  * This code using ```format!``` is very easy to read, and the code generated by the ```format!``` macro uses references so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.

### Indexing into Strings
* __In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a string by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation.__
* __However, if you try to access parts of a ```String``` using indexing syntax in Rust, you’ll get an error.__
* In other words, if you try to compile the code snippet below, you'll receive an error:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```
* __In short, the reason for such error is very simple: Rust strings don’t support indexing.__
