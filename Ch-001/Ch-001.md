## What is ```rustup```?
* __It's a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.__
* You'll need an internet connection for the download.
* The ```rustup``` tool install the latest stable version of Rust.

## Checking the installed version of Rust
* You can discover that by running the following command: ```rustc --version```.
    * The output should be the version number, commit hash and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released, in the following format: ```rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)```.
    * If you see such output, then you have installed Rust successfully!

## Updating and Uninstalling
* To update Rust to a newly released version, all you need to do is run the following command: ```rustup update```.
* To uninstall Rust and ```rustup```, run the following command: ```rustup self uninstall```.

## Local Documentation
* You can read a local copy of the documentation offline by running the following command: ```rustup doc```.
* It will open the local documentation in your browser.

## Side Note: Naming Rust files
* __The usual convention to name your Rust files is to use an underscore to separate the words, if there are more than one inside the file name.__

## Compiling and Running a Rust file by using ```rustc```
* Go to the directory where your Rust file is.
* Run the following commands:
    1. ```rustc <FILE_NAME>```
    2. ```./<FILE_NAME>```
