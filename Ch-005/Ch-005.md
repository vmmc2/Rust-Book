# Chapter 005 - Using Structs to Structure Related Data

## Intro
* A structure (or struct) is a custom data type available in Rust that lets you package and name multiple related values that make a meaningful group.
* The concept of a structure is very similar to the concept of an object's data attributes.
* As you've previously seen, a structure is not the only way to package multiple values. It's also possible to do such a thing by using tuples. However, there are scenarios where one is better than the other.
* It's also possible to define behavior associated to the created structure by defining associated functions. Such type of functions is called methods.

## Defining and Instantiating Structs
* Structs and Tuples are very similar in the way that both hold multiple related values.
* The pieces (values) of a struct can be different types, as it happens in a tuple. Unlike with tuples, in a struct you’ll name each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean.
* Moreover, when dealing with structs, you don’t have to rely on the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.
* The code snippet below shows how a struct is defined in Rust:
```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```
  * We define such a thing using the keyword ```struct```.
  * Then, we define a name for the struct. Such a name should tell us an idea of what the package of value represents.
  * Then, inside curly braces, we have the definition of the names and types of the pieces of data that make the struct, which we call fields.
* __To use a struct in Rust after we've define it, we should follow the steps below:.__
  * __To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields.__
  * __We create an instance by stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing ```key: value``` pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the data we want to store in those fields.__
  * __We don’t have to specify the fields in the same order in which we declared them in the struct.__
  * Example of Rust code snippet that does this:
  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
  }
  ```
* __To access a specific value from a struct, we must use dot notation. For example, if we want to access the email of the user defined in the code above, we need to write the following: ```user1.email```.__
* __IMPORTANT: If the instance of the struct is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a particular field. Otherwise, we can't do such a thing.__
  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };

    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
  }
  ```
* __IMPORTANT: Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable.__
* Tackling another subject, as with any expression, we can construct a new instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to implicitly return that new instance.
* Below, we have a code snippet that shows this functionality being used inside a function that builds and returns an instance of a struct:
```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username: username,
        email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Using the Field Init Shorthand
* This shorthand allows us to initialize an instance of a structure (struct) in a less verbose way.
* Take a look at the code snippet below that shows how this can be done:
```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        active: true,
        username, // username: username,
        email, // email: email,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax
* It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of the values from another instance, but changes some.
* Such a thing can be done by using the struct update syntax.
* Without the Struct Update Syntax, here's how one could create a new User instance whose value for the ```email``` field is different but all other values are equal to the values of another User instance previously declared:
```rust
fn main() {
  // --snip--  Here is the assignment of the first User instance to a variable called "user1".

  let user2 = User {
    active: user1.active,
    username: user1.username,
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
  };
}
```
* __Using the struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code. The syntax ```..``` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.__
```rust
fn main() {
  // --snip-- Here is the assignment of the first User instance to a variable called "user1".

  let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    ..user1
  };
}
```
* __VERY IMPORTANT NOTES:__
  * __Note that the struct update syntax uses ```=``` like an assignment. This is because it moves the data, just as we saw in the “Variables and Data Interacting with Move” section.__
  * __In the example presented above, we can no longer use ```user1``` as a whole after creating ```user2``` because the ```String``` value in the ```username``` field of ```user1``` was moved into ```user2```.__
  * __If we had given ```user2``` new ```String``` values for both ```email``` and ```username```, and thus only used the ```active``` and ```sign_in_count``` values from ```user1```, then ```user1``` would still be valid after creating ```user2```.__
  * __Both ```active``` and ```sign_in_count``` are types that implement the ```Copy``` trait, so the behavior we discussed in the “Stack-Only Data: Copy” section would apply.__

## Using Tuple Structs Without Named Fields to Create Different Types
* Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs.
* Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the fields.
* Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant (for example: when we want the new type to represent a point inside the 2D or 3D space or when we want the new type to represent a RGB pixel).
* To define a tuple struct, start with the ```struct``` keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple.
* Example code snippet:
```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```
* __IMPORTANT: Note that the ```black``` and ```origin``` values are different types because they’re instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct might have the same types.__
* Moreover, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a ```.``` followed by the index to access an individual value.

## Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
* You can also define structs that don’t have any fields!
* These are called unit-like structs.
* They behave in a similar way to ```()```.
* __Unit-like structs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.__
* Code snippet that declares and uses an Unit-Like Struct:
```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```

## Ownership of Struct Data
* __In the ```User``` struct defined in the first example of this chapter, we used the owned ```String``` type rather than the ```&str``` string slice type.__
* __This is a deliberate choice because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.__
* __It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes, a Rust feature that we’ll discuss later.__
* __Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.__
* __If you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes the compiler will throw an error.__

## Coding Program with Structs: Adding More Meaning
* __We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data.__
* __We can transform the tuple we’re using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as names for the parts (the fields inside the struct).__
```rust
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}

fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle {
    width: 30,
    height: 50,
  };

  println!(
    "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
    area(&rect1)
  );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
  rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```
* __Our ```area``` function is now defined with one parameter, which we’ve named ```rectangle```, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct ```Rectangle``` instance.__
* __As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than take ownership of it.__
* __This way, ```main``` retains its ownership and can continue using ```rect1```, which is the reason we use the ```&``` in the function signature and where we call the function.__
* __Remember that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance does not move the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs.__
* __Our function signature for ```area``` now says exactly what we mean: calculate the area of ```Rectangle```, using its ```width``` and ```height``` fields.__

## Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits
* It’d be useful to be able to print an instance of ```Rectangle``` while we’re debugging our program and see the values for all its fields.
* The ```println!``` macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly brackets tell ```println!``` to use formatting known as ```Display```: output intended for direct end user consumption.
* The primitive types we’ve seen so far implement ```Display``` by default because there’s only one way you’d want to show a ```1``` or any other primitive type to a user.
