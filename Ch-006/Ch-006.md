# Chapter 006 - Enums and Pattern Matching

## Intro
* __In this chapter, we’ll look at enumerations, also referred to as enums.__
* __Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants.__
* __Pay attention to the fact that enums, as structs, allow the user to define new types. However, its approach to do such a thing is completely different.__
* __In this chapter we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called ```Option```, which expresses that a value can be either something or nothing.__

## Defining Enums
* Comparing Enums and Structs:
  * Structs: Give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like a ```Rectangle``` with its field (```width``` and ```height```).
  * Enums: Give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values.
* Enums Use Case #1:
  * For example, we may want to say that ```Rectangle``` is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes ```Circle``` and ```Triangle```.
  * To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.
* Enums Use Case #2:
  * Say we need to work with IP addresses.
  * Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses: version four (v4) and version six (v6).
  * Because these are the only possibilities for an IP address that our program will come across, we can enumerate all possible variants.
  * Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not both at the same time.
  * That property of IP addresses makes the enum data structure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants.
  * Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling situations that apply to any kind of IP address.
  * We can express this concept in code by defining an ```IpAddrKind``` enumeration and listing the possible kinds of an IP address:
  ```rust
  enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
  }
  ```

## Enum Values
* We can create instances of each of the two variants of ```IpAddrKind``` like this:
```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```
