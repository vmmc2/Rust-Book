# Chapter 003 - Common Programming Concepts

## Variables and Mutability
* __By default, in Rust, variables are immutable. This is a good design decision because it favors safety and concurrency.__
* However, nothing stops you from making your variables mutable.
* You can make a variable mutable by adding the ```mut``` keyword in front of the variable name. Adding such keyword also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing this variable's value.
* Example of Rust code snippet:
```rs
fn main(){
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 13;
    println!("The new value of x is: {x}");
}
```
* __Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.__
